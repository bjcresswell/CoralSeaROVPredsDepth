# Effect of depth on predatory fish assemblages occupying isolated seamount reefs

This repository houses code for analysing changes in predatory fish communities with depth on three remote seamount reefs in the Coral Sea: Lihou, Osprey and Bougainville reefs, collectively referred to as LOB throughout this analysis.

The data used in this project are taken from 346 ROV transects conducted on these three reefs in 2021, ranging in depth from surface to 100m. Raw data are housed in a repository (FigShare) currently referenced in wrangling code and this repo is currently in draft state. Upon finalisation of this analysis, data will be made public with a final DOI and the code updated (as @ 20240624)
