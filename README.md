# Effect of depth on predatory fish assemblages occupying isolated seamount reefs

This repository houses code for analysing changes in predatory fish communities with depth on three remote seamount reefs in the Coral Sea: Lihou, Osprey and Bougainville reefs, collectively referred to as LOB throughout this analysis.

Note: the data repository (FigShare) currently referenced in wrangling code is a draft repo. Upon finalisation of this analysis, data will be made public on a final repo and the code updated (correct @ 20240624)
